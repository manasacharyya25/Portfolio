# About

> A Resume that's Interactive.

:page_with_curl: My Idea of a Perfect Resume was always something more than a Dead Plain PDF File. <br />

:boom: I wanted it to be interative. <br /> 

:exclamation: Hence this Portfolio App. <br />

:star2:It's interactive. <br />

:heart_eyes: Let's you click and navigate to exactly what you want to look at. <br />

:trollface: No Distractions. Afterall it's a Resume not Youtube.<br />

:pill: And my personal touch, the <strong>Tried It Once</strong> Section.<br /><br />
